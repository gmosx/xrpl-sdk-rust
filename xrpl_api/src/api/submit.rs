//! The submit method applies a transaction and sends it to the network to be
//! confirmed and included in future ledgers.
//!
//! This command has two modes:
//!
//! Submit-only mode takes a signed, serialized transaction as a binary blob,
//! and submits it to the network as-is. Since signed transaction objects are
//! immutable, no part of the transaction can be modified or automatically
//! filled in after submission.
//!
//! Sign-and-submit mode takes a JSON-formatted Transaction object, completes
//! and signs the transaction in the same manner as the sign method, and then
//! submits the signed transaction. We recommend only using this mode for
//! testing and development.
//!
//! To send a transaction as robustly as possible, you should construct and
//! sign it in advance, persist it somewhere that you can access even after a
//! power outage, then submit it as a tx_blob. After submission, monitor the
//! network with the tx method command to see if the transaction was
//! successfully applied; if a restart or other problem occurs, you can safely
//! re-submit the tx_blob transaction: it won't be applied twice since it has
//! the same sequence number as the old transaction.
//!
