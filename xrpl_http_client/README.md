let public_key = "...";
let secret_key = "...";

let offer_sequence = 123; // the sequence of the offer to cancel

let tx = Transaction::offer_cancel(account, offer_sequence);

let tx = client.prepare_transaction(tx).await?;

let public_key = hex::decode(public_key)?;
let secret_key = hex::decode(secret_key)?;

let tx = sign_transaction(tx, &public_key, &secret_key);
